# DC Tower-Elevators
About the solution:
* The elevators going down can stop between the starting and the destination floors and taking passangers, elevators going up can stop and let passangers out (number of passangers is always available).
* I assumed travelling between floors takes 1 second time. 
* In every second will be searched for free elevators to the queueing requests.
* Always the closest free or useable elevator is called to the starting destination.
